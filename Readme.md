We are going to be building a blog this week. Today is the first part, get use to setting up Models, Collections and Views. Also, this is a good time to start using Handlebars as your template engine.

Here is the data you will need to use

{
  "title": "", // String
  "content": "", // String
  "date": "", // String
  "status": "", // String
  "author": "", // String
  "tags": [] // Array of Strings
}

You are required to use both Backbone and Handlebars and the actions should be as followed:

1. Create a post => sends data to the server after you click "Create Post"
2. The new post should be prepended to the top of the post list (newest first)
3. The data should persist
4. All properties (except status) should be visible in the blog section

Also, use Parse for the backend.
